## **Found a bug?**

* Avoid opening any new issues without having checked if your problem has already been reported. If there are no currently open issues that fit your problem's description, feel free to [add it](https://github.com/W2Codam/MLX42/issues/new/choose).

* When writing an issue make sure to include a clear title and description as well as having filled out all the necessary information: System info, OS, OS-Version, ...

* If possible add pictures of the issue.

* Maybe fix it yourself :D ?

## Contributing

Before thinking of adding a contribution, think. Is it necessary? Will this actually be a useful/required feature? Is your implementation good?
Provide clear and documented explanation as to what was changed.
